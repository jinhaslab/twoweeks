<p>체계적 문헌 고찰을 매우 중요한 연구 과정입니다. 여러사람이 협업하는 경우 누군가 논문을 읽기 편하게 정리해 주는 과정이 필요합니다. 주로 EndNote와 같은 정리 프로그램을 사용하게 되는데요, 이을 데이터화하고 문서화하는 과정이 쉬워진다면, 협업에 도움이 될것 같습니다. 이번 시간에는 PubMed에서 논문을 찾아 정리하는 과정부터 데이터, 문서화까지 수행해 보겠습니다.</p>

<p>PubMed 검색 방법의 참고 문헌은 질병관리청의 미세먼지 근거보고서의 <a href="https://www.kdca.go.kr/contents.es?mid=a20304030600">검색전략</a> 관련 보고서입니다.</p>
<p>보고서 중에 심혈관질환의 검색 전략을 PDF는 아래와 같습니다.</p>
<embed src="./img/pubcvd.pdf" width="800px" height="460px" type="application/pdf" />
<p>각 Query 를 PubMed 에서 고급검색을 통해 지속합니다. 여기서 [MESH] 는 keyword 검색 [TIAB]는 제목(TItle)과 초록(ABstract)에서 검색한다는 의미입니다. 연세대학교 도서관의 pubmed 검색 문서를 꼭 읽어 보세요. <a href="https://ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PubMed_JW.pdf">PubMed 검색 연세대</a></p>
<embed src="./img/PubMed_JW.pdf" width="800px" height="460px" type="application/pdf" />
<p>질병관리 본문 검색전략을 따라 모두 검색을 수행한 후 검색 History에 있는 Query 문을 가져오는 것이 첫번째 단계입니다. 모두 글어 복사하고 이제 Rstudio를 열어 진행해 보겠습니다.</p>
